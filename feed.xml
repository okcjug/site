This month, local developer and entrepreneur Matt Hicks will be discussing <a href="https://github.com/outr/lightdb">LightDB</a>, a "computationally focused database using pluggable store + indexer", which leverages Scala as a core part of its architecture. This is a great chance to take another look at both a new technology and a JVM language that silently powers a number of high-scale workloads.</p>

<p>We will be meeting back at Starspace this month, and our meeting will be at 6:30pm so that those on the outer edges of the metro will have time to attend.</p>

<p>The phrase Denotational Semantics is an academic term for mapping
programs to mathematical objects as a way to define their meanings. This
phrase is not well-known in industry but we use it here to make it clear
that this presentation is a shamelss rip off of a talk by Erik Meijer of
a similar title. Erik Meijer, the founder of Applied Duality, is often
cited as the inventor of 'reactive', a group of frameworks which have
shown up in almost every programming language. The universal
applicability of Meijer&#8217;s initial reactive framework is attributed by
Meijer to long-established mathematical principles such as currying,
duality, and coproducts. With these few simple constructions we can
understand a wide variety of interfaces in a deeper way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a practical example, we will cover Meijer&#8217;s derivation of
Observable/Observer interfaces as duals of Iterable/Iterator interfaces.
The takeaway is that every developer can apply denotational semantics to
better design and implement common programs.</p>
