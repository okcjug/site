<h2>Speaker: Ryan Hoegg</h2>
<h2>Topic: <span class="im">Intro to Continuous Delivery</span></h2>
<span class="im">Continuous delivery is a central theme in the DevOps movement, and certainly a central component of the culture. It is the set of engineering techniques, practices, processes, and tools for releasing changes to software services frequently and reliably.</span>

<span class="im">Weâ€™ll review the concepts involved in CD, take a look a working CD pipeline for an example application, and discuss how this could apply to other projects.</span>
