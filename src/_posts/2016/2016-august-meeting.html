<h2>Speaker: Justin Strittmatter, Senior Software Engineer, MBO Partners</h2>
<h2>Topic: Howâ€™d we get here? - Event sourcing / CQRS pattern<span class="im">
</span></h2>
Weâ€™ve all come across many buzz words, new hyped techniques, and â€œThe next big thingâ€ in our reading.Â  For the last few years Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot about CQRS, Domain Driven Development, and Event Sourcing and thought it was time to find out what all the hype was about.Â  In this talk we will discuss the Pattern of event sourcing and CQRS and what some of the advantages/disadvantages are when implementing this pattern.Â  We will also do a high level code walk through using Java with the Axon Framework to implement this pattern in a microservice.
