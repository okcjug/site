Elasticsearch â€“ open source ,distributed-full text search engine,built
for speed. It offers solutions of scalability of big data search and it
is accessible through API . In the recent time due to rapid growth of
technologies, software development and its unprecedented utilization,
search engine has become a paramount resource. During my presentation,
we will see the basic concept of Elasticsearch,why should we care about
it and how does it serve a mind-boggling performance . At the end we
will see a few live examples of some the common use cases. We thank
