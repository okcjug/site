<h2>Speaker: <b class="gmail_sendername">Tamara Bartlett</b>, Software Developer and Consultant, ThoughtWorks</h2>
<h2>Topic: <span class="im">Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
</span></h2>
The topic ofÂ Infrastructure as Code (IAC) keeps cropping up in the world of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration but the topic can seem a bit abstract. But what if it's compared with something everyone is familiar with, like board games? Dip your toes into the basics of automated deployment and Infrastructure as Code through some fun board game analogies. Learn about the benefits, challenges and tooling of IAC.

<b></b>Tamara is a software developer and consultant currently working for ThoughtWorks. After graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering and a brief stint at Boeing doing software for satellites, she now is interested in DevOps, back-end software development, and ways to make software teams work harder, better, faster, stronger. In her free time, she runs, drinks excessive amounts of coffee, skydives, and attempts to do yoga. In the near future, she's looking forward to presenting this talk at Grace Hopper Conference (for women in computer science) and attending HashiConf to learn more about Infrastructure as Code.
