topic: "How 'd we get here? - Event sourcing / CQRS pattern"
---

We've all come across many buzz words, new hyped techniques, and
â€œThe next big thingâ€? in our reading.  For the last few years I 've
been seeing a lot about CQRS, Domain Driven Development, and Event
Sourcing and thought it was time to find out what all the hype was
about.  In this talk we will discuss the Pattern of event sourcing and
CQRS and what some of the advantages/disadvantages are when implementing
this pattern.  We will also do a high level code walk through using
Java with the Axon Framework to implement this pattern in a
microservice.
