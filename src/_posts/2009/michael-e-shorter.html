<p> <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mike_shorter.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-149" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px" /> Michael Shorter is a professional code poet who works for Power Costs, <a href="http://viagranonprescriptionusacanadahh.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">check</a>  Inc. He has been working with Java almost since its inception. Mike has been professionally programming over the past two and a half decades and has primarily worked in the arenas of systems architecture and systems programming. As a code poet, <a href="http://saleviagrawithoutperscriptionusaww.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">ambulance</a>  he has worked with over 27 different languages, <a href="http://edpillsviagraonlineusagg.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">salve</a>  and in environments ranging from mini and mainframe computers to n-tiered client server architectures. His operating system of choice is UNIX, or any derivative (spelled LINUX). When he first learned how to program, his goal was to write HAL-9000 from <em><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer" class="yshortcuts">2001: A Space Odyssey</span></em>, so his interests in the field of computing are neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and arithmetic and data persistence. Outside of computing, Mike enjoys dabbling in<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"> <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial" class="yshortcuts">high energy particle physics</span>, astrophysics, cosmology, quantum physics and comparative belief systems based on sacred texts - the goal being to integrate consciousness and life as basic forces of nature along with those specified by the Standard Model. He lives in Norman with his wonderful wife Tina Rae and their four Whippets Buster, Currie, Einstein and Newton.</font></p>
