== Presentation Information

On July 7, Oracle launched the long awaited Java 7 release. While this
release is described simply as "evoluationary", there's a lot of nice
new things in this release. Brent Loschen, a Systems Engineer with
Oracle's Embedded Java team, will give us a high-level overview of what
these new features are and what they mean to you as a developer. You may
not be able to use Java 7 yet in your enterprise, but after this
session, you'll be armed with the knowledge you need to being requesting
it
