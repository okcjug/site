As a Java Developer, we all want to be more productive. Spring Roo can
help by creating and managing your Spring-based applications by allowing
you to easily add and configure features such as JPA, Spring MVC,
WebFlow, JMS, Email, and Spring Security. For the June 2010 session, an
introduction to Spring Roo was presented. However, in this session, we
will revisit Spring Roo as a rapid application development framework,
examine it's default architecture, see how usage of AspectJ's Inter-type
declaration(ITD) features can reduce boilerplate code, quickly build and
deploy a complete Spring MVC application and show usage of the
incremental database reverse engineering (DBRE) addon.
