== Presentation Information

In this presentation, we'll take a "Hello, World" look at Android
development. We will develop, from the ground up, a very simple
application, covering such fundamental topics as Activities, Views,
Menus, and data access. Time permitting, we'll finish off the session
with a quick look at testing your Android application. We won't cover
every topic and API available to developers, but you should leave with
enough information to get you started on your own Android app.
