== Presentation Information

MapReduce: Distributed Computing with Apache Hadoop Scalable software is
built so that increasing data or usage does not result in degraded
service.  Distributed computing is one way to make data processing
software scale gracefully.
(from http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.0/mapred_tutorial.html#Overview):
"Hadoop Map/Reduce is a software framework for easily writing
applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte
data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of
commodity hardware in a reliable,
fault-tolerant manner."
In this talk, I will introduce the Map/Reduce algorithm, and demonstrate
how to write a Map/Reduce application using Java and Apache Hadoop.
