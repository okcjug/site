<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
On July 7, Oracle launched the long awaited Java 7 release.  While this release is described simply as "evoluationary", there's a lot of nice new things in this release.  Brent Loschen, a Systems Engineer with Oracle's Embedded Java team, will give us a high-level overview of what these new features are and what they mean to you as a developer.  You may not be able to use Java 7 yet in your enterprise, but after this session, you'll be armed with the knowledge you need to being requesting it
