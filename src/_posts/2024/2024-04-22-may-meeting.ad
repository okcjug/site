topic: "Pass or Play: What does GenAI mean for the Java developer?"
presentation: >
  GenAI, LLM, and other buzzwords are everywhere. The sea of acronyms can feel like (and sometimes actually are) a black box for the complex logic and processes that underpin them. Does/should a Java developer care?

  In this session, weâ€™ll explore how these technologies operate and cover many of the technical terms that go along with them, such as hallucinations, grounding, and more. We will understand the abilities GenAI can provide to technical solutions alongside some of the struggles they bring, as well. Live-code examples will show how Java developers can utilize GenAI and help determine whether they are worth the hype. Come see if you should pass or play on GenAI.

Our May meeting has been scheduled, and it should be another great one: Artificial Intelligence! This month, we will be
hosting a well-known speaker (and awesome person) from the St. Louis area, Jennifer Reif, who will be discussing generative AI and how it might of use (or not!) to us as Java developers.

Note that this meeting will be in our normal (can we still it that?) lunch hour slot at 11:30am. We will be meeting where we did last time at the Office of Managment and Enterprise Services (see the map to the right).
