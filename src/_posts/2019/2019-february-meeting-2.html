<h2>Topic: Essential Tools for Performance Metrics and Troubleshooting<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Every developer creating real-world applications will have to eventually troubleshoot code performance issues - sometimes even in Production systems. In this session we will show a couple of essential tools that every Java developer should know about and can use to gather detail performance metrics (CPU, Memory, Threads, Hot Methods, etc.). With the help of these tools you can get to the bottom of tough issues such as bottlenecks caused by locking and memory leaks. We will specifically cover Java Mission Control (JMC), and Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT).<br></p>
