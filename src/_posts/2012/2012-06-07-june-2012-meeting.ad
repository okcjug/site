Presentation Information

Implementing a data access layer of an application has been cumbersome
for quite a while. Too much boilerplate code has to be written to
execute simple queries as well as perform pagination, and auditing.
Spring JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data
access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that's actually
needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including
custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation
automatically. (Note, this approach is not limited to JPA and has been
applied to other persistance stores such as MongoDB and Neo4j as part of
the Spring MongoDB and Spring Neo4j projects). Spring JPA also takes the
concept of a specification from Eric Evans' book Domain Driven Design,
that carries the same semantics and provides an API to define such
Specifications using the JPA criteria API.
