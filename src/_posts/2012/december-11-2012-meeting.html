<div>Since we don't have a speaker for this month, we thought we'd have a party instead.We will provide the pizza and pop. Feel free to bring desserts.

If you want, bring a present and we'll exchange them somehow (by drawing names or playing some game).

Friends, significant others, and children are welcome.
