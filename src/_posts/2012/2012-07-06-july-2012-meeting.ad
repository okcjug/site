Presentation Information

When I tried to find a library that would allow me talk to a credit card
reader via serial/usb under Windows, I didn't find much that sounded
like it would work. Rxtx works pretty well. It has one .jar and two
.dll's (one for serial and one for parallel)" I'll talk about

* the Rxtx api
* finding serial ports
* my credit card reader applet (aka hexadecimal hell)
* some multi threading I'm doing in my applet
* some event listening code to use instead of multi threading
