I took a few minutes to update the
OKC JUG http://okcjug.org/about/sponsorship-information[Sponsorship
Information] page so that it reflects what we are actually doing for
sponsors in 2010.  Please check it out, and if you're interested in
sponsoring you can always email me to discuss it directly." We
appreciate our sponsors, their generosity is allowing us do a lot more
for the java community in OKC. On that note, we have two 2010 Annual
Sponsors already.  If you don't know about them, ObjectStream and MBO
Partners are both local companies who use java. [caption id=""
