=== Presentation Information

In the web services world, REST seems very quickly to be becoming the
preferred way to expose services. In this session, we will take a look
at how to build RESTful web services in Java using the
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311[JAX-RS specification]. We'll cover
the basics of JAX-RS, content negotiation, custom serialization, and
integration with the wider Java EE platform. We'll also take a quick
look at the https://jersey.dev.java.net/[Jersey] Client, and how that
can help writing more cleaner clients, including unit tests.
