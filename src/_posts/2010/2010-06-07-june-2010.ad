== Presentation Information

http://www.springsource.org/roo[Spring Roo] is an exciting new rapid
application development framework. It slices and dices and packs all the
punches of frameworks like Rails and Grails but the end result is pure
Java. In this presentation, we will be discussing what Spring Roo is and
demonstrate it's how it can be used to trim your development time and
make your code more readable.
