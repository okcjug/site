I took a few minutes to update the OKCJUG <a title="Sponsorship Information" href="http://okcjug.org/about/sponsorship-information">Sponsorship Information</a> page so that it reflects what we are actually doing for sponsors in 2010.Â  Please check it out, and if you're interested in sponsoring you can always email me to discuss it directly.

We appreciate our sponsors, their generosity is allowing us do a lot more for the java community in OKC.

On that note, we have two 2010 Annual Sponsors already.Â  If you don't know about them, ObjectStream and MBO Partners are both local companies who use java.
