topic: "Lightweight Development Environments with Vagrant"
---

On software development teams, a lot of time, effort, and
wasted work can come from the manual and unnecessarily complex way team
members set up their development environments.  Brett will explain the
ideas behind lightweight, reproducible, and portable development
environments, and demonstrate the use of Vagrant to create them.
