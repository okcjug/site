== Topic: Cloudy with a Chance of Java: Building Multitenant Java EE Cloud Applications

It's clear that the cloud is here to stay,
so software vendors must
either adapt or fade into irrelevance,
but how do you build an
app for the cloud? Building a single-user application is pretty
straightforward, but the cloud brings with it a new set of problems, the
most pressing of whichâ€”second possibly only to securityâ€”is data
integrity: how do you keep one customer from seeing and, worse, changing
another customer's data? This session discusses three ways to isolate
customer data: having separate databases; a shared database and separate
schemas; or a shared database and a shared schema. You 'll see working
code examples of each approach, so you 'll leave with everything you
need in order to get started on moving your app into the cloud.

== Pizza, Chairs, etc.
