== Topic: Akka Actors #

Have you been frustrated trying to write a multithreaded program and
sticking synchronized on all of your methods? Can 't tell your monitors
from your semaphores? There has to be a better way! In this talk,
we 'll discuss actor-based concurrency and how it can simplify
multithreaded programming. We will distill down Akka Actors, a JVM
implementation of the concurrency model that made Erlang famous. Hope to
see you there.

Bio: Dylan Forciea is a software engineer at Oseberg, Inc. in Oklahoma
City. He has worked on lots of object-oriented software using Java and
C++,  and now uses Scala to write software for the oil and gas
industry. Prior to joining Oseberg, he has worked on systems ranging
from image processing to satellite tasking and control to high rate data
acquisition applications at companies such as Raytheon and Sandia
National Laboratories.
