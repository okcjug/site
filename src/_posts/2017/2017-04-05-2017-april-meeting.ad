Hey Java Developers,

I've been meaning to talk to you about something. We've been working
together a while now, and I feel like you might not always give
Production the respect it deserves. You don't always invite it to your
requirements meetings, or work with it much during development.
Sometimes it feels like you just hand Production your code and move on
to other things!

I'm setting up a meeting next week (April 11) to see if
we can improve your working relationship.  Here's a rough agenda. I'll
bring some background on these things, and I hope I can get some good
conversation started and improve your relationship:

* Service Discovery
* Configuration
* Secrets
* Health
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Telemetry
* Capacity



Please go to Meetup and sign up so we will have a count for the food.
