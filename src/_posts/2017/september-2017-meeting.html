<h2>Topic: <span class="im">Reactive Streams
</span></h2>
<div dir="auto">

Ever read bytes from a file, packets from a network socket, records from a database, or messages from a message queue and run into problems with I/O blocking, throttling, or resource management? Find yourself writing more boilerplate code than business logic to stream data? In a world where operations are asynchronous, data is "live", and transactions per second are measured by the millions, streaming data has never been more important. Enter Reactive Streams. Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. In this talk, I'll introduce the "What's" and "Why's" of Reactive Streams and give demonstrations using akka-streams on the JVM.

<strong>Bio</strong>: Jordan is a software engineer at Oseberg and leads the Data Platform team. He founded OKC-FP, a user-group focused on functional programming.
