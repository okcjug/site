== Topic: [.im]#Stick a fork in the websocket, it's done #

I've wanted to make an app in the cloud (aka someone else's server) that
uses several technologies.

This is an indolent walk through of what I've come up with so far.

The list of technology I plan on using is, javax.websocket, json,
javascript, mapbox-gl.js (vector tile map), sqlite-jdbc, and Rest.

If there is time, deploy it to gcloud (App Engine). I may have to use
http://mapbox.com[mapbox.com] or node.js to serve the map tiles instead
of sqlite-jdbc if I don't have time.

My plan is to display a map of the world, click on the map to create a
marker which then gets broadcast to anyone else on the web page.

Clicking on a marker deletes it from everyone's map.
