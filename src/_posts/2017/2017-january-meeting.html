<h2>Speaker: <span class="m_-8007405605425576190gmail-il">Ray Tsang
</span></h2>
<h2>Topic: <span class="im">gRPC 101 for Java Developers
</span></h2>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">gRPC is a high performance, open source, general RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. gRPC is based on many years of Google's experience in building distributed systems - it is designed to be low latency, bandwidth and CPU efficient, to create massively distributed systems that span data centers, as well as power mobile apps, real-time communications, IoT devices and APIs. It's also interoperable between multiple languages.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">But beyond that fact that it's more efficient than REST, we'll look into how to use gRPC's streaming API, where you can establish server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming! This allows developers to build sophisticated real-time applications with ease.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">In addition to learning about gRPC and HTTP/2 concepts with code and demonstrations, we'll also deep dive into integration with existing build systems such as Maven and Gradle, but also frameworks such as Spring Boot and RxJava.</div>
<ul>
 	<li dir="auto">Writing/using a Spring Boot starter to run gRPC server</li>
 	<li dir="auto">Configuring projects to generate gRPC stub code</li>
 	<li dir="auto">Integrating w/RxJava's observable sequences, which matches very well with gRPC's Stream Observable constructs</li>
</ul>
