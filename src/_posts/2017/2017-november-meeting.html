<h2>Topic: <span class="im">The Lagom Microservice Framework
</span></h2>
<div dir="auto">

So you're going to build a microservice system. And this is not just any system. This system is going to process a ton of traffic, and it cannot go down - no excuses! This session covers techniques and tools that you can use to scale individual microservices up or down as traffic rates change. We also look at hardening your system eliminating single points of failure and automatically recovering when various outages occur. The cornerstone of this approach is Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). ES and CQRS provide the platform for both scale and resilience. We will see how this is done using Java, the Akka toolkit, the Play framework, and the Lagom microservice framework.

<strong>Speaker Bio</strong>: Hugh McKee is a developer advocate at Lightbend. He has had a long career building applications that evolved slowly, that inefficiently utilized their infrastructure, and that was brittle and prone to failure. That all changed when we started building reactive, asynchronous, actor-based systems. This radically new way of building applications rocked his world. As an added benefit, building application systems became way more fun than it had ever been. Now he is focused on helping others to discover the significant advantages and joys of building responsive, resilient, elastic, message-driven applications.
