May 17-19] For a long while, we've built applications pretty much the
same way. Regardless of the frameworks (or even languages and platforms)
employed, we've packaged up our web application, deployed it to a server
somewhere, and asked our users to point their web browser at it. But now
we're seeing a shift in not only how applications are deployed, but also
in how they're consumed. The cost and hassle of setting up dedicated
servers is driving more applications into the cloud. Meanwhile, our
users are on-the-go more than ever, consuming applications from their
mobile devices more often than a traditional desktop browser. And even
the desktop user is expecting a more interactive experience than is
offered by simple page-based HTML sites. With this shift comes new
programming models and frameworks. It also involves a shift in how we
think about our application design. Standing up a simple HTML-based
application is no longer good enough. In this session, we'll discuss
what the next generation of applications looks like, exploring such
things as the mobile web and cloud computing. We'll also dig into some
of the technologies and practices such as REST, OAuth, and JavaScript
microframeworks that enable us to move forward.
