<div>This presentation will use several sorting algorithms to explore how to evaluate how "good" your algorithm is and the process by which to test and evaluate it.</div>
We will explore the Quciksort in java and Groovy.</div>
If time allows we will also look at bubble sort, merge sort and heap sort.

</div>
We will use the Big O notation to determine the "Goodness" of an algorithm.

</div>
Come and build your ability to examine and think about the quality of your algorithms. This will be especially important to us as we begin to face the daunting task of dealing with today's Big Data demands.
