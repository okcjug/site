<div>Ask a random IT person about the systems in his environment, and chances are that the answer will sound something like this:</div>
<div>"Well, we are almost done with the new release of Whiz Bang, which uses Spring Data, AMQP, and MongoDB with a lot of jQuery for the front end.Â  That's being held up because of our maintenance release of Beige and Dusty, which most of our customers use.Â  They both send information to FileCabinet 11.8r3, which we bought from a vendor 16 years ago, and we still have our invoicing system in Decrepit 6, which runs on AS400."</div>
<div>It seems like everyone has a bunch of different systems with a lot of different technologies involved.Â  Integration is what we do to get them all working together.</div>
<div>This talk is about how to do integration with Mule ESB, and includes a walk through of anÂ <a href="http://www.confluex.com/blog/mule-example-imperial-manufacturing/" target="_blank">example project</a>.</div>
