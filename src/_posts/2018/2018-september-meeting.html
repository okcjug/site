<h2>Topic: Oracle Turns Java up to 11</h2>
At the end of this month, Oracle is scheduled to release Java 11. In this session, we'll see what's new in the latest revision of the world's most popular programming language. We'll start with a rundown of features, including those added in Java 10 to get us to date, and end with examples of Java 11's additions.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Due to a scheduling conflict at StarSpace46, we will be meeting this month at Clevyr. Many thanks to Aaron Krauss for the hospitality!</span>
