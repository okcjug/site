Google Web Toolkit is a development toolkit for building and optimizing
complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive
development of high-performance web applications without the developer
having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and
JavaScript. Basically software is written in Java and then translated
into JavaScript. It is open source, completely free, and used by
thousands of developers around the world. More information is available
