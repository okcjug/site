image:/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/bubba%2060x80.jpg[image]Brian has been
a programmer since 1987 and has been a java developer for Hertz since
2002. He is more passionate about getting the job done than making it
pretty. He is not proud of his code. If you know a better way to do
something, go for
it.

He has been married since 1982 and has two wonderful daughters.
