brett-schuchert:
  name: Brett Schuchert
  bio: >
    Brett Schuchert has over 20 years of teaching experience and 17 years of
    professional software development experience. Starting in the mid 80's
    he taught computer literacy courses. At the end of the 80's while still
    teaching, he began professionally developing first in C++ (before C++
    had multiple-inheritance) and working with Smalltalk (and for a short
    stint back he used a pre-ANSI, K&R type 1 C compiler for embedded
    systems development). He continued with C++ and Smalltalk training and
    consulting, managing to work with both C++ and Smalltalk on the same
    project using object-oriented database technology for the short time it
    was in vogue.
    <p/>
    In 1997 he developed and deployed his first Java application on top of
    Java 1.0, which he later migrated to Java 1.1 to take advantage of the
    newly-added Java Serialization. The project used applets to directly
    update the DOM of a complex web page to avoid the full turn-around of an
    HTTP get (this is now referred to as AJAX).
    <p/>
    He has continued developing enterprise-level applications in Java and
    has recently changed the emphasis of his training and mentoring towards
    software professionalism.
