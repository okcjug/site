We have two mailing lists:Â  one for general JUG discussions, and another for Steering Committee discussions. Both lists are public, and anyone is welcome to join either.Â  If you're interested in the details of running the JUG, the Steering Committee list is a good resource.Â  If you are only interested in JUG updates and general JUG/Java discussions, then the general list is what you want.

The <strong>general list</strong> can be subscribed to <a title="General JUG list info page" href="http://lists.okcjug.org/listinfo.cgi/jug-okcjug.org" target="_blank">here</a>, and the <strong>Steering Committee list</strong> can be subscribed to <a title="Steering Committe List info page" href="http://lists.okcjug.org/listinfo.cgi/sc-okcjug.org" target="_blank">here</a>. To search for and read previous emails, go to the <a title="the Jug Archive" href="http://lists.okcjug.org/pipermail/jug-okcjug.org/">Jug Email Archive</a>.

These lists exist as a resource for the JUG membership, so please don't be shy about using them!
