Mockito is a Java framework that (in the project's own words) &quot;tastes really good&quot;. I'll briefly present the different ways to use stubs and mocks, then roll up my sleeves and get into the code with you.  Those of you who have not done much with mock objects will leave with a basic understanding of the technique and the Mockito library.  Those of you who are already familiar with the technique, come armed with your tough questions!
