<h2>Our Leadership</h2>
The leadership of the JUG is very populist, having a Steering Committee that meets once a month to plan the various JUG events, as well as making long term decisions for the JUG. These meetings are open to everyone, with the membership of the Steering Committee being loosely defined as those who consistently attend the meetings. We do, however, have a basic structure to which we assign the ultimate responsibility of ensuring the functions and decisions of the Steering Committee are carried out. This very small structure consists of a president and treasurer. Currently, those posts are held by:

* President: <a href="http://okcjug.org/bios/mitch-blevins">Mitch Blevins</a>
* Treasurer: Brent Wilkins<a href="/bios/scott-centille">
</a>
