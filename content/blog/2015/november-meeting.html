<h2>Speaker:Â Kenyatta Clark</h2>
<h2>Topic:Â Docker for Java Developers</h2>
Producing good software is a goal many of usÂ strive for by honing our skills at design principles, <a href="http://saleviagrawithoutperscriptionusakk.net/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">site</a>  language mastery, architecture,Â methodologies, and expert use of libraries, frameworks, and platforms. Â Satisfied with our code, we then figure out how to deploy it, or we hand it over to an operations team who handles running it in production.

Running software in production is the whole point! Â We can applyÂ a lot of our skills and practices from software development toÂ its deployment, and to the infrastructure on which it runs.

<a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker" target="_blank">Docker</a> is "an open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins" that provides a standardized way to package applications with the specification of their environment. Â This meansÂ everything from the operating system to the application server is specified in code, and will be identical between your environments.
<h4>Pizza, Chairs, etc.</h4>
