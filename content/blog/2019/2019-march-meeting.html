<h2>Topic: Microservices with Micronaut<br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As microservices have exploded on to the scene, so have microservice frameworks. In the JVM world, we have a myriad of options. In an already crowded space, though, a new framework has appeared that is extremely promising. Micronaut is a polyglot microservice framework from the inventors of the Grails framework, supporting Java, Kotlin, and Groovy out of the box. Micronaut ships with support for a wide number of capabilities, including dependency injection, aspect oriented programming, object relational mapping (via JPA or GORM), cloud native features (Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes, AWS, and others), serverless/functions-as-a-service, and many more. It even comes with a testing framework.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we'll see how to get started using Micronaut using a small subset of those features as we build a simple REST service.<br>We'll use JPA for persistence, and secure the application using JSON Web Tokens, all fully tested. At the end of the session, we'll have a solid foundation for building microservices using this new offering.<br></p>
