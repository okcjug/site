<h2>Topic: What Is Functional Programming and Why Should You Care?<span class="im">
</span></h2>
It's hard to ignore the growing number of Functional Programming languages. Haskell, Scala, Clojure, F#, Erlang, R, and many more. But what is Functional Programming and why should you care?Â  This talk sets out to demystify FP, debunk common misconceptions, and highlight ways FP can solve certain problems. Stuck with Java or C#. No worries! Functional programming doesn't require a purely functional programming language. It's a different way of building. Let's get functional!
