<h2>Speaker: Brett Schuchert</h2>
<h2>Topic: Legacy Refactoring</h2>
This is an updated version of a legacy refactoring demonstration. Weâ€™ll have a look at some code that is a mess (what code isnâ€™t) and then work through the code using two different approaches. One, using JMockIt - a power mocking tool, the second, plain vanilla legacy refactoring. Weâ€™ll compare and contrast the differences and then see how well the power mocking tool holds after the plain old legacy refactoring approach.

Weâ€™ll touch on some of the important things to keep in mind when working with legacy code and, more importantly, the smallest unit of reasonable legacy refactoring.
