<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">Have you been frustrated trying to write a multithreaded program and sticking synchronized on all of your methods? Canâ€™t tell your monitors from your semaphores? There has to be a better way! In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss actor-based concurrency and how it can simplify multithreaded programming. We will distill down Akka Actors, a JVM implementation of the concurrency model that made Erlang famous. Hope to see you there.</div>
