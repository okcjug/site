Recently, JetBrains held the (inaugural?) KotlinConf in San Francisco. Along with the conference came management application to help attendees manage their schedule. What made the application unique is that every part was written in Kotlin: the web site, the mobile application and the shared backend.

In this session, we will look at some of these technologies, namely the web application framework Ktor and the Android application development library Anko, as we build a vastly simplified mobile app and backend. This demo application should give you all you need both to understand how each of these projects work as well as how to build your mobile application, all in Kotlin.
