Sponsorship is one aspect of the JUG many of our members are aware of, but probably spend little time thinking about.Â  Trust me, those of us on the steering committee think long and hard about this!Â  We are always trying to find ways to enrich our community through new members and, of course, the content and atmosphere of our meetings.
