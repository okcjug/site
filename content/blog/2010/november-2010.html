<h3>Presentation Information</h3>
In the web services world, REST seems very quickly to be becoming the preferred way to expose services.  In this session, we will take a look at how to build RESTful web services in Java using the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">JAX-RS specification</a>.  We'll cover the basics of JAX-RS, content negotiation, custom serialization, and integration with the wider Java EE platform.  We'll also take a quick look at the <a href="https://jersey.dev.java.net/">Jersey</a> Client, and how that can help writing more cleaner clients, including unit tests.
