<h3>Presentation Information</h3>
In this presentation, we'll take a "Hello, World" look at Android development.  We will develop, from the ground up, a very simple application, covering such fundamental topics as Activities, Views, Menus, and data access.  Time permitting, we'll finish off the session with a quick look at testing your Android application.  We won't cover every topic and API available to developers, but you should leave with enough information to get you started on your own Android app.
