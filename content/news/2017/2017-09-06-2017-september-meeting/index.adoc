topic: "Reactive Streams"
---

Ever read bytes from a file, packets from a network socket, records from
a database, or messages from a message queue and run into problems with
I/O blocking, throttling, or resource management? Find yourself writing
more boilerplate code than business logic to stream data? In a world
where operations are asynchronous, data is "live", and transactions per
second are measured by the millions, streaming data has never been more
important. Enter Reactive Streams. Reactive Streams is an initiative to
provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking
back pressure. In this talk, I'll introduce the "What's" and "Why's" of
Reactive Streams and give demonstrations using akka-streams on the JVM.
