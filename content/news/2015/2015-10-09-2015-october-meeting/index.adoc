topic: "Test Driven Development Workshop"
---

It's been some time since we've practiced Test Driven Development
(TDD) in the JUG. This week we 'll start with a problem some of us have
seen before. We 'll work through it, making group
decisions, writing code and working on the rhythm of tdd. Brett will
bring a wireless mouse and keyboard, so you can participate (if you want)
remotely. We 'll either work through a few problems or the same problem
a few times. If you're coming looking for slides, look elsewhere.
You 'll see an IDE and an empty test file. OK, let's go!
