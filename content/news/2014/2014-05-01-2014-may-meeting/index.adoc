This month we have two presentations, so
get there early! First, Jason Richards will show us some tips about
writing a resume from years of experience helping candidates tune
theirs.

Then, Jeff Bowman will present about lambdas in Java 8.

We're meeting at 11:30am on Tuesday, May 13 at the Northwest Library.  As
always, lunch will be provided. Looking forward to seeing you there!
