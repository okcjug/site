Sponsorship is one aspect of the
JUG many of our members are aware of, but probably spend little time
thinking about.  Trust me, those of us on the steering committee think
long and hard about this!  We are always trying to find ways to enrich
our community through new members and, of course, the content and
atmosphere of our meetings. After talking to some of our sponsors, we
have expanded and reworked our
http://okcjug.org/about/sponsorship-information[sponsorship options] in
preparation for 2011.  Please take a look and tell any organizations
you think might be interested in helping our community.  We greatly
appreciate or sponsors, who have made this JUG possible for over five
years.  You can see some of our current sponsors to the right of this

seductive, beckoning you to click on it and see what lies behind..."
