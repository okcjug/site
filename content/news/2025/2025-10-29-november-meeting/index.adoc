topic: "Java is Data!"
presentation: >
    Data is at the center of any organization. So it stands to reason that data should be at the center of how we design and write our Java applications. In this talk we are going to look at how recent changes to the Java language; Records, Pattern Matching, Seal Hierarchies, are enabling Java applications to be written in a Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) paradigm. We will look at the core concepts of DOP, and how it compares and contrasts with the OOP approach familiar to many Java developers.

Our November meeting has been scheduled, and we have a special treat this month. Billy Korando, Java Developer Advocate with the Java Platform Group at Oracle and co-organizer of the https://kcjug.github.io[Kansas City Java User Group], will be paying us a visit to bring one of his many great, well-received presentations to us. He's a popular speaker at conferences, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the presentation. And learn a lot.

This month, we'll be back at StarSpace 46 at 6:30PM on November 11. Please RSVP over at https://www.meetup.com/oklahoma-city-java-user-group/events/311765818/[Meetup]! I look forward to seeing you there!
