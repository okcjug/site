I know we've been down this road before, but I intend to not let it slip this time. :) I'd really like to get this going in SOME fashion. If you have any interest in helping me run the JUG (and I need all the help I can get!), please see our mailing list (or its archive) for more details and to join the discussion.

Here is our mailing list info for the interested:
